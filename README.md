# Diabetes Prediction Project

This project leverages machine learning to predict whether an individual has diabetes based on various health metrics. It includes an interactive web application built with Streamlit, which allows users to input their health information and receive a prediction on whether they may have diabetes.

Features:
User-Friendly Interface: The application features a simple and intuitive interface where users can input their age, gender, health history, and other relevant metrics. <br>
Machine Learning Model: The project utilizes a trained random forest model to provide predictions. The model is trained on a diabetes dataset and is able to classify individuals as either diabetic or non-diabetic. <br>
Visualizations: In addition to the prediction feature, the application offers visualizations of dataset, providing insights into the distribution of data and how it impacts the prediction.

Acknowledgments:
The project is based on a publicly available diabetes dataset, which is used to train the machine learning model. We appreciate the contributors and sources of the data.
